## Homescreen Repo

This is a repo of various Android homescreens. All the homescreens have been created using an app called [Kustom Live WallPapers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper&hl=en_CA). KLWP is an application used to develop homescreens on the android device itself. It is only possible to export wallpapers through the app, so here I have provided a demo of the homescreens using a screen recording. 

## Black Pink Homescreen

Inspired by the internationally popular korean-based girl pop band [Blackpink](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmHUn--16B90oW2L6FRR3A), this homescreen takes a dualist approach to homescreen design. The home page has a black background with bold pink accents meant to show off the striking visuals of the rap line of the group. The widgets are kept minimal, separated by gradients, but can the functionality can be quickly deduced. 

The secondary pink screen with bold black icons is meant to show off the attractive vocal line of the band, but not by omitting their bolder features as well. This is the easily accessible application page where the most commonly used applications can be found. 

The homscreen is tied together with smooth fading animations when swiping between the screens, as well as the Blackpink header in the drop down settings menu.

## Line Fading Homescreen

This homescreen brings together a combination of three homescreen styles together. The left-most screen page has three horizontal bars for media controls, calender information, and weather. Most of the icons are clear so as to make a free flow between the content and the background wallpaper. 

The center screen is a custom dynamic wallpaper that periodically pulses. The right most screen is an app drawer of custom designed, commonly used applications.

## Rose Homescreen

Inspired by a tattoo art sample, this wallpaper is centerred around the tribal pattern and rose. All of the controls are at the bottom of the screen to facilitate use with a larger phone and one-hand. 

With only one screen, the functions can be toggled by pressing the middle button between media controls and others. Of course the main color scheme is: white, black and red.
